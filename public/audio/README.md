# Audio File Needed

Please add a smoke detector chirp sound file here named `chirp.mp3`.

The audio should be:
- Format: MP3
- Duration: 0.5-1.5 seconds (single chirp)
- Sound: Classic smoke detector low battery beep
- Volume: Moderate (will be set to 40% in code)

You can source this from:
1. Record an actual smoke detector
2. Sound effect library (e.g., freesound.org, search "smoke detector chirp")
3. Generate synthetic beep (800Hz, 0.5s duration)

The site will work without this file, but the audio player won't play any sound until you add `chirp.mp3` here.
